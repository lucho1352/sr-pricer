### Design Aspects

* This Service implements a strategy pattern to segregate the calculation of the price
by brandId, bare in mind that if you add more strategies you  will need to use
qualifiers to inject the beans.

* This service also uses a H2 repository to store the prices for the given brand and product

* Finally, for tracking purposes the services has a Filter in which we are calculating and logging
the time taken to perform a given action, and in addition we send in the response a header
that represents the uuid of the transaction. 

### Pending Work

1. Implement logback to create a pattern to log in ay APM
2. Implement spring security base on your needs
